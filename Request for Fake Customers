Here’s a summary of the requirements you provided for generating the fake company data:

Quantity & Structure:

Generate 50 fake company names total.

Deliver data in a CSV file format.

Additional Fields:

For each company, include:

Email Address (realistic but fake, based on the company name and random domains)

Phone Number (U.S.-style, randomly generated)

Full Address, split into the following columns:

Address Line 1 (random street number + common street name)

Address Line 2 (random suite number)

City (chosen from a fixed list of real U.S. cities)

State (full name, matched to the chosen city)

Country (always “United States”)

Zip Code (real ZIP code corresponding to the city)

Data Quality Preferences:

Use real U.S. cities.

Ensure state names are spelled out in full.

Match ZIP codes accurately to the cities.

Standardize country as "United States".

General Formatting and Output

Deliver data files (e.g., fake company lists) in Excel-compatible CSV format.

CSVs must include consistent column headers:
Company Name, Email Address, Phone Number, Address Line 1, Address Line 2, City, State, Country, Zip Code

All addresses must be realistic and U.S.-based:

Use real U.S. cities and ZIP codes that accurately match each other.

States must be spelled out in full (e.g., “California,” not “CA”).

Country should always be "United States".

Company Name Rules

Each company name consists of two parts:

A unique first word (never repeated across the same dataset).

A second word selected from a pool of professional business terms (e.g., “Solutions,” “Industries,” “Holdings,” “Consulting,” etc.).

The first word should:

Be a real English word, not made up.

Sound natural for a company name (e.g., “Summit,” “Harbor,” “Frontier,” etc.).

Be unique within each batch (no duplicates).

The second word should be varied but can repeat across records (e.g., multiple companies might use “Solutions”).

Contact Information

Email addresses:

Based on the company name (e.g., summitventures@company.org).

Domains randomized among: @gmail.com, @outlook.com, @corp.net, @business.io, @company.org, @enterprise.com.

Phone numbers:

Realistic U.S.-style: (XXX) XXX-XXXX, generated randomly.

Addresses:

Address Line 1: random street number + real-sounding street name.

Address Line 2: “Suite” followed by a random 3-digit number.

Data Quality Requirements

Each dataset should contain 50 total records.

Cities and ZIP codes should be diverse, not heavily concentrated in one state or region.

Must avoid repeating or reusing the same “first word” across companies within the same file.

Generated company names should sound plausible for real businesses (no fantasy-style or nonsensical words).

Stylistic and Technical Preferences

No emojis in responses.

Keep responses professional and clearly structured.

Generated files should be clean, exportable, and fully compatible with Excel.

If additional batches are generated, they must continue using unique first words (i.e., no overlap with prior CSVs).
